# Test_DLL_ALL

Hi, 

Here the final result of my test to generate DLL with IDE Code::Blocks. 

You can read (very long story ...) how I can construct these DLL with many free compilers available on Windows system.
You will can understand how progressly it is possible to integrate all of these compilers into CB to generate many 
operational DLL on Windows 11 64 bits (Family Edition). 

11 000 lines to understand. Too long, no, it' s necessary to explain in details the generation by example, illustrated by
all results of tests of DLL.

Please, take time to read the final bilan : Bilan_DLL_ALL.txt 

After, you can donwload all of the code source, scripts, projects and workspace CB.

Then, you can repeat on your environment all of operations to succeed contruct of DLL.

Thank you, good reading, and if the result you agree, send me mail.

Sincerly.

Thierry DECHAIZE
